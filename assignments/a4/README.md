# Overview

A4 contains a director named `Fotaga289sing` which contains the project files and an apk file named `fotag_a289sing.apk` The target version for this app
is Android 8.0 Oreo

My laptop is unable to run Android Studio at all. I talked with Jeff to come up with a solution. We agreed that I could use my personal Android device for testing purposes and develop this project in computer labs in MC building. I used Xiaomi Mi A1([official spec page](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-a1/specs/), [Alt. spec page](https://m.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_a1_(mi_5x)-8776.php#global)) to develop and test this app instead of using a Pixel virtual device. My device has been updated to Android 8.1.0 and runs with 4GB of RAM.

The font used for the title in this app has been taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous)

# Running the app
The app can be run by either installing the apk on any Android device running Android 8.0 or above or by opening the project in Android Studio
and running the project on a virtual device runing Android 8.0 or above.

# Functionality
The app can load images using the **load** button in the top app bar. They can tap on the **clear** button to clear all the ratings and images. A **filter** functionality is also provided which lets users filter images based on a certain rating.

All the images (and the filter) can be set to any rating between 0-5 (both inclusive). To set a rating, users can tap on the numbers of stars they want to give the image. To set a rating of zero users can swipe all the way to the left in the rating bar until all the stars disappear.

The app can run in both orientations, portrait and landscape. 

To view the full image, the users can tap on any image and a popup will open up with the full image view. In this view they can set/change their ratings. To save their ratings, users csn tap on the **OK** button. To dismiss the popup or to discard any changes, users can tap on the **CANCEL** button or touch anywhere outside the box.
