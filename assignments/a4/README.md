My laptop is unable to run Android Studio at all. I talked with Jeff to come up with a solution. We agreed that I could use my personal Android device for testing purposes and develop this project in computer labs in MC building. I used Xiaomi Mi A1([official spec page](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-a1/specs/), [Alt. spec page](https://m.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_a1_(mi_5x)-8776.php#global)) to develop and test this app instead of using a Pixel virtual device. My device has been updated to Android 8.1.0 and runs with 4GB of RAM.

The font used for the title in this app has been taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous)
